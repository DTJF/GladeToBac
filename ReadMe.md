Welcome to the *GladeToBac* (= GLADE TO BAsiC) project, a FreeBASIC
code sketcher. It's a cross-platform and multifunctional tool to
generate matching FreeBASIC source code from
[GTK](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GTK) user interface files generated
by application
[Glade3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glade_Interface_Designer).

The package is [hosted at GitHub](http://github.com/DTJF/GladeToBac)
and it contains

- the source code of the *GladeToBac* application in folder `src`
- some data files for that application in folder `data`
- some locale files for internationalisation (i18n) in folder `locale` (currently `de` only)
- examples for testing the tool in folder `Demo`

The purpose of that tool is to load and analyse a Glade3 user interface
description file, and generate matching FreeBASIC source code depending
on some previously set custom parameters. This contains

- generating FB source files for a GTK application
- generating the *.pot file for internationalisation (i18n)
- generating project files for different IDEs

The code is self-hosting (generated by itself), and so contains a lot
of examples. Find more information at the world wide web:
