FreeBASIC Source Code
=====================

This folder contains the source code for the application `GladeToBac`,
a source code generator for GTK user interface files generated by
`Glade3`.

It supports the current `GtkBuilder` technique as well as the
deprecated `libglade` library. Never use `libglade` for a new project,
it's deprecated!

In order to compile the application execute `fbc -w all GladeToBac.bas`
in this folder. Befor using the binary you should move it to the root
folder, in order to get access to the `data/` folder.
