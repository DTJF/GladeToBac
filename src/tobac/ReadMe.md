FreeBASIC GUI Code
==================

This folder contains the source code for the GUI bindings for the
application `GladeToBac`. All files are auto-generated by this
application:

- The file GladeToBac_tobac.bas glues all sources together, and gets
renewed on each run. Do not edit this file.

- The file GladeToBac_gui.bas contains the context of the file
`../GladeToBac.ui` as FreeBASIC code, and gets renewed on each run. Do
not edit this file. The intension of the file is to compile the UI
description in to the main binary, and therefor having less files to
ship.

- All other files got initially auto-generated, but customized later.
They contain the actions taken when a certain signal gets invoked from
the GUI. So this files make the application alive.
