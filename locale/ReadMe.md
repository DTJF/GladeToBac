===============

GladeToBac is prepared for internationalisation (i18n). The original
code generates a user interface in English language. This can get
translated in other languages using [gnu gettext and
libintl](https://www.gnu.org/software/gettext/).

This folder contains a translation to German (de). Feel free to add
your mother tongue, and share the result.
